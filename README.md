# California_OFW

This project overlays polygons that represent ocean monitoring programs in California and shows the essential ocean variables that they measure. Also included are the proposed wind energy areas (Humboldt County and Morro Bay). This visualization is intended to help scientists and policy-makers prioritize baseline monitoring efforts in areas in and around the wind energy areas that need additional monitoring. 

Written in R and uses libraries from Leaflet and Shiny.
